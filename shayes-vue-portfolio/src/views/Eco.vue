        <h1>Eco wesbite Redesign</h1>
    <h2>Brief:</h2>
    <p>Eco’s (Enviroment and conservation organisation) website currently 
is outdated and are looking to do an overall re-branding of the website. 
The information architecture makes it hard for the user to find
information they are looking for on the website. They want to create 
eye catching website that draws the user in while still inline with their 
brand identity, as well as the overall usability of the website.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>To re-design the quality of their website to improve the user flow, 
functionality and overall re-branding of the website. </p>

              <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
 <p> - Lack of information user flow.</p>
<p>- Too much information packed into a page.</p>
<p>- Heaps of links through the website can be hard to navigate.</p>
<p>- Use of gradient in footer looks outdated.</p>
<p>- Lack of imagery and high quality photos.</p>

            <h1>User Testing Results</h1>
            <p>
                Changes made during user testing is to have the home page as the only one with the background image 
so it is easier for the user to see if they are back on the home page. On the get involved page there isn’t any need 
for another donate section as its in they Nav and the layout of the donation page needs to have less imagery and 
better user flow and confirmation page added so they user knows it was successful.
